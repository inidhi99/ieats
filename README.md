This apps main goal is to provide an effective user interface when planning to eat at or selecting restaurants/cafes in nearby locations, currently only operational in the 5 boroughs of NYC, NY. 

## User Story

As the user i would like to access map information and place information at the palm of my hand while never losing the weather and forecast in said area. 
Once populated the place card should include some pertinenet information to ease decision making and planning.
Possibility of walking or taking other means of transportation would have to be assumed by the forecast and weather data

## Description

This app is meant to improve quality of life for those users who hate bad weather but still want to go out with their friends. Ever planned to go out with your friends in approximately 3 hours only to find out when you leave the house looking immaculate that it begins to rain, snow or sleet. This app provides weather information built into restaurant information so that the user can choose whether to walk or take other means of transportation and never get hit with unwelcomed weather changes again.

Some challenges which were faced while producing this project was implementing different API's and frameworks into our code. Implementing a wide variety of google information and weather information while also formatting the css and html layouts. Other issues faced was the application every bit and piece we learned over the last few weeks into a real active project. Learning to use GitHub for its purpose of working as a team is was in fact very challenging and hard to manage. Adding tasks and preparing presentations on top of accessing and writing code showed how difficult projects may be for time management

## How to Use
-Load the project
-Select which borough you would prefer (set to all initially).
-Search for restaurants and/or cafe's in your selected area.
-When selecting the place a place card pops up with information.
- weather and distance all displayed in the palm of the hand for easy planning.

## Future

In the future incorporation of more features is immanent, incorporating more information on each placecard, creating and accessing a server to improve the placard for each restaurant including seating options and price ranges,add more pleasant decorative features such as symbols for weather widget, including other popular city/states and eventually countries along with other UX/UI improvements. Incoporate AI to advise user of what is a better course of action such as walking or train/cab. 

The goal for this app is to hold a high standard for those willing to choose us for theior everyday needs. Stay dry!! Those that would like to contirbute and help our goal please feel free to contact us using the [github link](##Links) above.
