This apps main goal is to provide an effective user interface when planning to eat at or selecting restaurants/cafes in nearby locations, currently only operational in the 5 boroughs of NYC, NY. 

## Description

This app is meant to improve quality of life for those users who hate bad weather but still want to go out with their friends. Ever planned to go out with your friends in approximately 3 hours only to find out when you leave the house looking immaculate that it begins to rain, snow or sleet. This app provides weather information built into restaurant information so that the user can choose the best seating arrangments and never get hit with unwelcomed weather changes again.

Some challenges which were faced while producing this project was implementing different API's and frameworks into our code. Implementing a wide variety of google information and weather information while also formatting the css and html layouts. Other issues we faced was putting every bit and piece we learned over the last few weeks into a real active project.

## How to Use
-Load the project
-Select which borough you would prefer (set to all initially)
-Search for restaurants and/or cafe's in your selected area
-When selecting the place a modal pops up with information on place
-seating, weather, ratings all displayed in the palm of the hand for easy planning
